# Analysis of Voting Mechanisms in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

This repository showcases my seminar project, conducted under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Fabian Sch√§r, titled 'Analysis of Voting Mechanisms in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations'. 
It features Python-based analysis of various voting systems such as Quorum-Based Voting, Delegated Voting, and Quadratic Voting, with an in-depth exploration of Uniswap's governance model. 
This project is a part of my academic endeavors in the Masters in Business and Technology program at the University of Basel.
